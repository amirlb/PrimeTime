# Prime number clock

In the tweet exchange [starting here](https://twitter.com/wtgowers/status/1400360909684477954)
I learned that there's a 1-1 correspondence between the hours in the week
and prime numbers under 1000.

So it's possible to create a clock with this as the hours display, which you
can see in action at [this link](https://amirlb.github.io/prime-clock/).
